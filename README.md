# Repository Overview

This repository contains a small demo showcasing a UI behavior scenario.

Iâ€™ve added several buttons to the interface. Depending on certain conditions, some buttons can be interacted with, while others cannot. When a button is disabled, I wanted to give users a clear explanation of why itâ€™s unavailable.

To do this, I wrapped each button inside a Badge control. When interaction is not allowed, a badge is displayed along with a tooltip text describing the reason.

In some cases, the same rule applies to multiple buttons. To keep things consistent, I decided to reuse the same badge and tooltip string across them â€” so the user sees a unified explanation.

However, when I tried binding the same PackIcon instance to multiple badges in XAML, I noticed that only the first buttonâ€™s badge displayed the icon correctly. The others showed no icon at all.

Iâ€™m wondering if this behavior is related to object instancing, or if thereâ€™s something else Iâ€™m missing. Iâ€™d really appreciate any feedback or explanation about why this happens!

Feel free to review it or even go over it on stream â€” I donâ€™t mind at all ðŸ™‚
Thank you!

# Usage of demo
Click on "Click Me" button to make the buttons non-available.

# Bonus
Not at all related to the badge problem. Updating to the latest MDIX, I observed that with every Combobox I add to my UI it comes with a binding error now. I have added one in here to.
The binding error is : "System.Windows.Data Error: 5 : Value produced by BindingExpression is not valid for target property. null BindingExpression:Path=(0); DataItem='ComboBox' (Name=''); target element is 'ComboBox' (Name=''); target property is 'Name' (type 'String')"
